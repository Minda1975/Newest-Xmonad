# Newest-Xmonad
My new xmonad configuration for Debian stable

Also, for automatic installation, i wrote a script. Be aware, that it install proprietary nvidia driver. Please check [Debian wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers). 
If your system using diferent graphic card, just comment out section `sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver`.

Also don't forget to check this script and adapt it to your needs. It is very simple script. 

P.S.

This script must be run as super user (sudo). And for the best result, run this script after installing base Debian with no GUI.

The final product :)

P.S.

Also i added configuration file for Xmonad without xmobar (in main tree).
